# Truth vs. Virality: A Data-Driven Dive into the Spread of Misinformation
## Using SQL, Google Sheet and Tableau

In today’s hyperconnected world, social media isn’t just a place to scroll and entertain, it’s where opinions are formed, narratives are shaped, and influence is spread. As someone who grew up with the rise of social media, I’ve come to recognize how easily misinformation can blur the line between fact and fiction.

And that line matters, because we live in a world where viral content spreads faster than verified facts, no matter if the content is true or not.

Why this matters: The consequences of misinformation are real. From fueling public panic during pandamic to distorting facts around environmental, social and political issues, misinformation can manipulate behavior at a massive scale.

So how can we detect it early? What differentiates a factual piece of information from a misleading one in the eyes an average user? These are some of the questions that drive this project.

In this data analysis project, I dive into the TruthSeeker dataset, which contains over 100,000 labelled and reviewed social media posts. By combining exploratory data analysis and sentiment tracking, this project aims to **understand the spread of misinformation** and **identify patterns that differentiate truthful content from misinformation**.

Understanding how misinformation spreads is not just an academic pursuit, it’s a responsibility we share in today’s digitalized world. This project combines my technical skills with the critical digital challenge that I care about. The insights gained here could be potential to inform more mindful content consumption and sharing.

The following methodology with 6 steps are implemented for this project:

**1. Ask:** Define the business problem or objective by understanding the key questions that need to be answered and identifying stakeholders’ needs.

**2. Prepare:** Gather and evaluate the relevant data, ensuring it’s accessible, complete, and appropriate for the analysis by cleaning and organizing the datasets.

**3. Process:** Clean and transform the raw data, checking for errors, inconsistencies, or missing values to ensure that it is reliable and ready for analysis.

**4. Analyse:** Apply analytical techniques to explore the data, identify patterns, trends, and relationships, and extract actionable insights relevant to the business problem.

**5. Share:** Present findings through reports, visualizations, or dashboards in a clear, understandable and engaging way to communicate key insights to stakeholders.

**6. Act:** Use the insights gained to inform decision-making, implement solutions, or recommend strategies that address the original business question or problem.
